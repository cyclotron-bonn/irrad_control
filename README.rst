Irrad_Control |test-status|
=============================

Introduction
============

``irrad_control`` is a Python package for data acquisition and control of the proton irradiation site at the 
`Bonn isochronous cyclotron <https://www.zyklotron.hiskp.uni-bonn.de/zyklo/index_EN.html>`_, 
located at the Helmholtz Institut für Strahlen- und Kernphysik (`HISKP <https://www.hiskp.uni-bonn.de/>`_), of Bonn University.
The software features a graphical user interface (GUI), based on `PyQt <https://riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/intro>`_, 
from which the individual setup components can be managed and irradiations can be conducted. Furthermore, the GUI offers online data
visualization of proton beam characteristics and irradiation-specific quantities such as e.g. proton fluence.
The setup control and data acquisition is provided by a (or multiple) Raspberry Pi (RPi) server which is managed by ``irrad_control``,
all acquired data is stored in the binary `HDF5 <https://www.pytables.org/>`_ format. The software furthermore provides a set of analysis methods
for irradiation datasets which produce comprehensive plots.

Installation
============

Python >= 3.8 is required (Py3.8 & 3.9 are tested). It's recommended to use a Python environment separate from your system Python. To do so, please install `Miniconda <https://conda.io/miniconda.html>`_.
After installation you can use the package manager ``conda`` to setup an isolated envirnoment. To create a new Python 3.8 environment, named ``irrad``, type

.. code-block:: bash

   conda create -y -n irrad python=3.8

followed by ``conda activate irrad`` to activate the created Python environment. To install ``irrad_control`` run

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install -e .

which installs in editable mode, allowing to make changes to the code if needed. Finally, to launch the software run

.. code-block:: bash

   irrad_control

When you start the application you can add RPi servers in the **setup** tab. Each server needs to be set up before usage.
The procedure is explained in the following section.

Quick Setup
============

The data acquisition and control of irradiation setup is done by one (or multiple) Raspberry Pi (RPi) server. Before first usage with `irrad_control`,
each server RPi needs to be aware of the ``ssh key`` of the host PC. Therefore, copy the hosts ``ssh key`` to each RPi server via

.. code-block::

   ssh-copy-id pi@ip-address-of-rpi

where ``ip-address-of-rpi`` is the IP address of the RPi within the network. In case you need to create a ``ssh key`` of the host PC first, you can do so by

.. code-block::

   ssh-keygen -b 2048 -t rsa

After launching ``irrad_control``, you can perform a first-time-setup of the server by adding it via its IP address.
The server is then automatically set up on first use with ``irrad_control``.


Offline Analysis
================

From version v1.3.0 onwards, ``irrad_control`` ships with offline analysis utilities, allowing to analyse e.g. irradiation or calibration data.
The output of ``irrad_control`` are two different file types with the same base name (e.g. ``my_irrad_file``), one containing the configuration (*YAML*) and the other the actual data (*HDF5*).
Both files are required to be present in the same directory.
To analyse irradiation data (e.g. NIEL / TID / fluence) use the ``irrad_analyse`` CLI:

.. code-block:: bash

   irrad_analyse -f my_irrad_file  # No file ending required; --damage (NIEL, TID) is default analysis flag 

which will generate a ``my_irrad_file_analysis_damage.pdf`` output file. Optionally, the ``-o my_custom_output_file.pdf`` option / value pair can be given to give a custom output file name.
To analyse multiple files at once, pass them individually to the `-f` otpion

.. code-block:: bash

   irrad_analyse -f my_irrad_file_0 my_irrad_file_1 my_irrad_file_2
   irrad_analyse -f *.h5  # Analyse all HDF5 files in the current directory

Furthermore, irradiations which were carried out in multiple sessions (e.g. multiple output config / data files) can be analysed by passing the ``--multipart`` flag.
To analyse an multi-file irradiation, pass the list of file base names

.. code-block:: bash

   irrad_analyse -f my_irrad_file_0 my_irrad_file_1 my_irrad_file_2 --multipart
   irrad_analyse -f *.h5 --multipart  # Take all HDF5 files in the current directory

To analyse beam monitor calibration measurements, pass the ``--calibration`` flag.

.. code-block:: bash

   irrad_analyse -f my_calibration_file --calibration
   irrad_analyse -f *.h5 --calibration  # Take all HDF5 files in the current directory

To see the CLI options type

.. code-block:: bash

   irrad_analyse --help

Fluence Distributions
---------------------

1 MeV neutron equivalent fluence distribution with their respective uncertainties, generated by the ``irrad_analyse`` CLI,
from irradiation data of an ITkPixV1 Si-pixel detector, irradiatied to 1e16 neq/cm².

Proton Irradiation Site
=======================

The proton irradiation site for silicon devices at Bonn University is in operation since early 2020. Typically, a proton beam of 14 MeV kinetic energy, a current of 1 µA and a diameter of a few mm
is used to irradiate devices-under-test (DUTs) in a temperature-controlled box. To achieve homogeneous irradiation, the DUT is scanned through the beam in a row-wise grid, using a two-dimensional 
motorstage. The fluence is determined via online measurement of the beam current at extraction to the DUT during the irradiation procedure. A picture of the setup can be seen below. For further
information on the setup, the irradiation procedure & characteristics or addiational material please visit the `homepage <https://www.zyklotron.hiskp.uni-bonn.de/zyklo/experiments_cyclotron_EN.html#one/>`_
